## Hi there 👋

### Who am I?

Hello there, this is Lourenço! I'm an economist by training, farmer by trade, nerd by passion. Been using GNU/Linux full-time since I built my first PC at 14; with a knack for system administration (I manage my own e-mail server, IRC server, private DNS resolver and sinkhole, etc), I excel at developing new solutions to problems I have - the hacker ethos.

I'm a pretty eclectic person, with a wide range of hobbies. At the moment these include gardening, hiking, photography and programming in Golang. Get in touch, and I'm sure we'll hit it off!

### What more?

🔭 I’m currently contributing to #mgmtconfig: https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt

🌱 Recently I'm focusing on improving my Golang! How? These are the most recent examples: [http-server-go](https://github.com/lourencovales/codecrafters/tree/master/http-server-go) (simple http server written using TCP primitives) and [shell-go](https://github.com/lourencovales/codecrafters/tree/master/shell-go) (a REPL shell written in go)

🌍 I'm originally from Portugal, but I'm now located in Kraków, Poland

⚡ Fun fact: the kiwifruit has one of the highest contents of vitamin C of all known fruits - even more than an orange!
