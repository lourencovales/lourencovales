## Hi there 👋

### Who am I?

Hello there, this is Lourenço! I'm an economist by training, farmer by trade, nerd by passion. Been using GNU/Linux full-time since I built my first PC at 14; with a knack for system administration, I excel at developing new solutions to problems I have - the hacker ethos.

I'm a pretty eclectic person, with a wide range of hobbies - which at the moment include gardening, hiking, photography and programming in Golang. Get in touch, and I'm sure we'll hit it off!

### What more?

-🔭 I’m currently contributing to #mgmtconfig: https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt

-🌍 I'm originally from Portugal, but recently moved to Kraków, Poland
