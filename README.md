## Hi there 👋

Hello there, this is Lourenço! I'm an economist by training, farmer by trade, nerd by passion. Been using GNU/Linux full-time since I built my first PC at 14; with a knack for system administration, I excel at developing new solutions to problems I have - the hacker ethos.

I'm a pretty eclectic person, with a wide range of hobbies - which at the moment include gardening, hiking, photography and programming in Golang. Get in touch, and I'm sure we'll hit it off!

🔭 I’m currently contributing to #mgmtconfig: https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt
🌱 I’m currently learning Golang!
📫 How to reach me? Have a look at my personal website: https://lourencovales.github.io/
⚡ Fun fact: the kiwifruit has one of the highest contents of vitamin C of all known fruits - even more than an orange!
